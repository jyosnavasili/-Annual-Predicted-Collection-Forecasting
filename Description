Description:
Developed a predictive model to forecast annual collections based on historical data, enabling better financial planning and decision-making.

Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
SQL
ETL Tools (Apache Nifi, Airflow)
Tableau
Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gathered historical collection data from multiple sources using Apache Nifi.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python (Pandas) to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Stored the cleaned data in a SQL database for easy access and analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to understand trends, seasonality, and patterns in the historical collection data.
Visualized key metrics and insights using matplotlib and seaborn.
Model Development:

Developed multiple predictive models using Python (Scikit-learn, Statsmodels), including:
Linear Regression
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks for time-series forecasting
Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Model Selection and Optimization:

Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Optimized the model by tuning hyperparameters and incorporating additional features (e.g., economic indicators, seasonal effects).
Prediction and Visualization:

Generated annual collection forecasts using the selected model.
Created interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize historical data, model predictions, and confidence intervals.
Provided actionable insights and recommendations based on the forecasted data.
Outcome:

Achieved an accurate and reliable forecast of annual collections with an error margin of less than 5%.
Enabled better financial planning and resource allocation, improving overall efficiency.
Provided stakeholders with a clear and interactive visualization of predicted collections, enhancing decision-making capabilities.

Example Dashboard Layout (Tableau)
Historical Data Visualization:

Line chart showing monthly collections over the past years.
Seasonal decomposition plot to visualize trends, seasonality, and residuals.
Forecast Visualization:

Line chart showing the predicted collections for the next 12 months.
Confidence intervals to indicate the uncertainty in predictions.
Key Insights and Recommendations:

Summary of forecast accuracy and key findings.
Recommendations for financial planning based on forecasted collections.
This project will demonstrate your ability to handle end-to-end data analysis, from data collection and preprocessing to model development and visualization. It also showcases your expertise in predictive modeling, ETL processes, and creating actionable insights for stakeholders.
